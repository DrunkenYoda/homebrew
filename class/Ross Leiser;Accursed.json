With a look, a sigh, and flick of his wrist, the brawlers both slip on an errant puddle of grog, hit their heads on tabletops, and fall unconscious. Finally arriving at the bar, the drow can enjoy his drinks. An elf argues with herself as she engages an orc raiding party in combat. Recalcitrantly, a spirit exits the elf's body, a thin cord of Ethereal energy connecting the two, and fights alongside her, unleashing a terrible scream that causes the bandits all to drop dead of fright.",

An archer comes around the corner, and she throws her sword, impaling the guard before he can even nock an arrow.
